===============================================================================
                        6. TRAINING CONCEPTS
===============================================================================

EPOCH:
An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset. During each
epoch, the model sees every training example once and updates its parameters
based on the computed gradients.

BATCH:
A batch is a subset of the training data processed together. Instead of updating
parameters after each sample, we accumulate gradients over a batch and then
update. This provides more stable gradients and computational efficiency.

GRADIENT DESCENT:
Optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts model parameters to minimize
the loss function. The gradient indicates the direction of steepest increase,
so we move in the opposite direction.

BACKPROPAGATION:
Algorithm for computing gradients in neural networks. It propagates the error
backward through the network, computing gradients for each parameter using
the chain rule of calculus.

OVERFITTING:
When a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. Signs
include high training accuracy but low validation accuracy. Our model showed
this behavior (100% training vs 73.63% validation).

REGULARIZATION TECHNIQUES:
- Dropout: Randomly set some neurons to zero during training
- Weight Decay: Add penalty term to loss function
- Early Stopping: Stop training when validation performance degrades
- Data Augmentation: Increase dataset size with variations

===============================================================================
                         7. BASIC LEVEL Q&A
===============================================================================

Q1: What is NLP?
A1: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that enables computers
    to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines 
    computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning.

Q2: What is tokenization?
A2: Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called
    tokens, typically words or subwords. For example, "Hello world!" becomes
    ["Hello", "world", "!"].

Q3: What is an embedding?
A3: An embedding is a dense vector representation of words or tokens. Instead
    of representing words as sparse one-hot vectors, embeddings map words to
    continuous vector spaces where similar words have similar representations.

Q4: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in NLP?
A4: Supervised learning uses labeled data (e.g., sentiment analysis with 
    positive/negative labels), while unsupervised learning finds patterns in
    unlabeled data (e.g., topic modeling, word embeddings).

Q5: What is sentiment analysis?
A5: Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the emotional tone or opinion
    expressed in text. It typically classifies text as positive, negative, or
    neutral.

Q6: What is an epoch in machine learning?
A6: An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset. If you
    have 1000 training samples, one epoch means the model has seen all 1000
    samples once.

Q7: What is a batch in training?
A7: A batch is a subset of training data processed together before updating
    model parameters. For example, with batch size 32, the model processes
    32 samples, computes gradients, and then updates weights.

Q8: What is overfitting?
A8: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including
    noise and specific patterns that don't generalize to new data. The model
    performs well on training data but poorly on test data.

Q9: What is the purpose of train/validation/test splits?
A9: - Training set: Used to train the model
    - Validation set: Used to tune hyperparameters and monitor training
    - Test set: Used for final evaluation of model performance

Q10: What is accuracy in classification?
A10: Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions.
     Accuracy = (Correct Predictions) / (Total Predictions) × 100

===============================================================================
                      8. INTERMEDIATE LEVEL Q&A
===============================================================================

Q1: What is the attention mechanism and why is it important?
A1: Attention allows models to focus on relevant parts of the input when making
    predictions. Instead of using only the final hidden state, attention 
    computes weighted combinations of all hidden states. This solves the 
    bottleneck problem in sequence-to-sequence models and enables better 
    handling of long sequences.

Q2: How does self-attention work in Transformers?
A2: Self-attention computes attention weights between all positions in a 
    sequence. For each position, it creates Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V)
    vectors. Attention weights are computed as softmax(QK^T/√d_k), then applied
    to values: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V.

Q3: Why do we need positional encoding in Transformers?
A3: Unlike RNNs, Transformers process all positions simultaneously and have no
    inherent notion of sequence order. Positional encoding adds position 
    information to input embeddings using sine and cosine functions, allowing
    the model to understand word order.

Q4: What is multi-head attention?
A4: Multi-head attention runs multiple attention mechanisms in parallel, each
    focusing on different types of relationships. The outputs are concatenated
    and linearly transformed. This allows the model to attend to information
    from different representation subspaces simultaneously.

Q5: What are residual connections and why are they used?
A5: Residual connections (skip connections) add the input of a layer to its
    output: output = layer(input) + input. They help with gradient flow during
    backpropagation, enabling training of deeper networks and preventing the
    vanishing gradient problem.

Q6: What is layer normalization?
A6: Layer normalization normalizes inputs across the feature dimension for each
    sample independently. It stabilizes training, reduces internal covariate
    shift, and often allows for higher learning rates and faster convergence.

Q7: How does the Transformer handle variable-length sequences?
A7: Transformers use padding to make all sequences the same length, then apply
    attention masks to ignore padded positions. This allows batch processing
    while maintaining the original sequence information.

Q8: What is the difference between encoder and decoder in Transformers?
A8: - Encoder: Processes input sequence and creates representations
    - Decoder: Generates output sequence using encoder representations
    - Encoder uses self-attention, decoder uses both self-attention and 
      cross-attention to the encoder output.

Q9: What is teacher forcing in sequence generation?
A9: Teacher forcing is a training technique where the decoder receives the true
    target sequence as input instead of its own predictions. This speeds up
    training but can cause exposure bias during inference.

Q10: How do you prevent overfitting in Transformers?
A10: - Dropout: Randomly zero out neurons during training
     - Weight decay: L2 regularization on parameters
     - Early stopping: Stop when validation performance degrades
     - Data augmentation: Increase dataset diversity
     - Reduce model complexity: Fewer layers/parameters

===============================================================================
                       9. ADVANCED LEVEL Q&A
===============================================================================

Q1: Explain the mathematical formulation of scaled dot-product attention.
A1: Scaled dot-product attention is computed as:
    Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
    
    Where:
    - Q (queries): n×d_k matrix
    - K (keys): m×d_k matrix  
    - V (values): m×d_v matrix
    - √d_k scaling prevents softmax saturation for large d_k
    - Output: n×d_v matrix
    
    The scaling factor √d_k is crucial because dot products grow with dimension,
    pushing softmax into regions with small gradients.

Q2: How does the Transformer achieve parallelization compared to RNNs?
A2: RNNs process sequences sequentially: h_t = f(h_{t-1}, x_t), creating 
    dependencies that prevent parallelization. Transformers use self-attention
    to directly connect all positions: each position can attend to all others
    simultaneously. This allows parallel computation of all positions, 
    significantly reducing training time.

Q3: What are the computational complexities of different attention mechanisms?
A3: - Self-attention: O(n²d) where n is sequence length, d is dimension
    - RNN: O(nd²) but sequential (can't parallelize)
    - CNN: O(knd²) where k is kernel size
    - For long sequences (n > d), self-attention is more expensive
    - Various optimizations exist: sparse attention, linear attention

Q4: Explain the gradient flow in Transformers and why residual connections help.
A4: In deep networks, gradients can vanish exponentially as they propagate back.
    Residual connections provide direct paths: ∂L/∂x = ∂L/∂y(1 + ∂F/∂x)
    The "+1" ensures gradients don't vanish completely. This enables training
    of very deep Transformers (e.g., GPT-3 with 96 layers).

Q5: What is the difference between absolute and relative positional encoding?
A5: - Absolute: Fixed position embeddings added to input (our implementation)
    - Relative: Encodes relative distances between positions
    - Relative is often better for longer sequences and generalization
    - Examples: Shaw et al. (2018), Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)

Q6: How do you handle the quadratic memory complexity of attention?
A6: Several approaches:
    - Sparse attention: Only attend to subset of positions
    - Linear attention: Approximate attention with linear complexity
    - Gradient checkpointing: Trade computation for memory
    - Mixed precision training: Use FP16 instead of FP32
    - Sequence chunking: Process long sequences in chunks

Q7: What is the role of the feed-forward network in Transformers?
A7: The FFN provides:
    - Non-linearity through ReLU/GELU activation
    - Position-wise transformation: same network applied to each position
    - Increased model capacity: typically 4× larger than attention dimension
    - Can be viewed as key-value memory with learned associations

Q8: How does attention visualization help interpret model behavior?
A8: Attention weights show which input positions the model focuses on for each
    output position. This provides insights into:
    - Syntactic relationships (subject-verb agreement)
    - Semantic relationships (coreference resolution)
    - Model biases and failure modes
    - However, attention weights don't always indicate causality

Q9: What are the limitations of the Transformer architecture?
A9: - Quadratic complexity in sequence length
    - Limited ability to handle very long sequences
    - Lack of inductive biases (compared to CNNs for images)
    - Requires large amounts of data
    - Difficulty with compositional generalization
    - Attention can be noisy and unfocused

Q10: How would you adapt this model for other NLP tasks?
A10: - Text Classification: Add classification head (our approach)
     - Sequence Labeling: Output label for each token
     - Question Answering: Predict start/end positions
     - Text Generation: Use decoder architecture with causal masking
     - Machine Translation: Full encoder-decoder with cross-attention
